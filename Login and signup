LOGIN AND SIGN UP PAGE ITS
A login form generally consists of a username or email field, a password field and a bottom for logging in. 
Some of the login page may also include captcha which helps to prevent automated login attempts.

The login process generally deals with 2 major items: username and password.
When a user enters username and password in respective field and clicks on login button, the credentials are checked in database and promoted accordingly.
In case the credential combination is correct, the user will be able to log in else not.
We can also implement 2 step authentication in login where after successfully entering username and password, user will go through another step of verification.
